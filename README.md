# notapsychai

notapsychai is not a psychiatrist.  If that is what you seek, look elsewhere.

notapsychai is also not for people who cannot write code. It is a place for software engineers and
hackers to discuss what such a service looks like for the general population.  For that reason, the
general population is welcome to participate, but is not expected to be able to run notapsychai.

Once upon a time, in an era before LLMs, I wanted this as a service.  The problem was that there was
no good way to record data from the user when they were in a state requiring psychiatric
intervention.  In the era of LLMs, it is easy to take unstructured input and turn it into structured
output.  Right now, that's all notapsychai does.

At best, notapsychai's a poor replacement for an SRE servicing humans.  By that, I mean to say that
notapsychai currently only collects signals.  It does nothing with them.

Next Steps:
- Solicit professional feedback on what questions should be asked daily, weekly, monthly, randomly.
- Find a way to tune the prompts in use on synthetic data, specifically prompts around alcohol seem
  fragile.
- Standardize the data collection format for interop between tools.
